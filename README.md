# Make My Outfit â€” PWA Starter (Dual-mode uploads)

A Progressive Web App that generates outfit images and supports **two delivery modes**:
- **Server-managed** upload (server uploads to a bucket and returns a public URL)
- **Direct client upload** into an outfit-maker's Cloud Storage bucket via signed URL 

In the app, click **Set API Key** and paste your API key (the app forwards it to the server via X-API-Key).
